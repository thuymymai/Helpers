# Helpers

An IOS mobile application which acts as an assistive platform connecting the ones in need of assistance, especially people with
disabilities with the volunteers in the society who are willing and available to give help. The idea is to build a mobile application using Swift programming language while integrating user interface control with SwiftUI. The project was divided into six development sprints in which a daily meeting was held among developers to update tasks, features and fix errors.
